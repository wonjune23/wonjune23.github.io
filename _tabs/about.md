> Hello World!
{: .prompt-tip }

### Who
I am wonjune cho, currently working as a computer vision engineer.

### Why
Simply solving a problem (or at least thinking that we've solved it), and then moving on to solve another one is just not enough to fully understand the nature of the problem that we solved (Actually, I don't think it's even possible to say that we've *solved a real engineering problem*, but you get the point). Why is it not enough? It's either because we later forget what / how we did, or because we somehow solved a problem without fully understanding the underlying nature of it. This is possible thanks to google, open-sourced softwares, or chatGPT, etc.

So, to understand better and fully internalize all the knowledge that I encountered, I thought I'll just try writing things down on this blog. It helps me to concretely understand all the underlying concepts by trying to express them in my own language. Hopefully, it could also help others to understand the topic by reading my posts.

### What
I work on basically every topics in this field: from conventional 3D geometric computer vision to more recent generative AI models. I try to express them as easy as possible, but, certain level of basic knowledge about the field is required.
